redis-grep is a Python shell script that allows searching through Redis values
using regular expressions (compatible with Python's `re` module).

For the moment, it only knows how to search string and list entries. Filtering
key names is possible using the `--key` switch which accepts a Redis style pattern
like the one used by the `KEYS` command.

By default, it will stop as soon as it finds a match. Use the `--all` switch to
turn off this behavior.


    $ regis-grep --help
    Usage: redis-grep [options] <pattern>

    Options:
    --version             show program's version number and exit
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -a, --all             don't stop on first match
    -k key, --key=key     limit search to keys matching this pattern
    -o host, --host=host  host address of the Redis server
    -p port, --port=port  port number of the Redis server
    -d db, --db=db        database number of the Redis server
